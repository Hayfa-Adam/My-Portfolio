## About Me
 
I am an accounting and finance graduate with a passion for data analysis. I have had the opportunity to work across various industries, including education, design, customer service and accounting and finance. Throughout these experiences, I have developed a range of key skills, such as effective time management, problem-solving, and the ability to communicate with diverse stakeholders, including students and suppliers.  

I am currently enrolled in an 8-weeks intensive Data Skills Bootcamp with Just IT Training, aiming to consolidate my skills further and become a data analyst. I am focused on enhancing my proficiency in Excel, Tableau, and Power BI to effectively clean, organize, analyse, and visualize data, making it easier for decision-making processes.

My immediate goal is to establish myself as a Junior Data Analyst role in a financial environment, where I can leverage my existing knowledge and acquire new skills. I have completed several data projects using Excel, SQL, Python, Tableau, and Power BI, which are showcased in my GitHub and Tableau Public portfolios.
